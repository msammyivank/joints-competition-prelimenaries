# Preliminaries - JOINTS 2021 Data Science Competition

**Jogja Information Technology Session (JOINTS)** was a nationwide Data Science competition conducted by Universitas Gadjah Mada, one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia. It was conducted through Kaggle for many Indonesian data science enthusiasts. There was 44 teams with approximately 120 people that entered the competition, and my team successfully acquired **first place** in the public leaderboard & **second place** in the private leaderboard.

The challenge was to predict if a certain customer would like to prolong his/her insurance period. There were various features in the dataset, including Gender, Age, Area Code, Vehicle Age, and more.
