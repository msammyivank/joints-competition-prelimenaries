# Preliminaries - JOINTS 2021 Data Science Competition

**Jogja Information Technology Session (JOINTS)** was a nationwide Data Science competition conducted by Universitas Gadjah Mada, one of the most prestigious universities in Indonesia. It was conducted through Kaggle for many Indonesian data science enthusiasts. There was 44 teams with approximately 120 people that entered the competition, and my team successfully acquired **first place** in the public leaderboard & **second place** in the private leaderboard.

The challenge was to predict if a certain customer would like to prolong his/her insurance period. There were various features in the dataset, 

The challenge was to find **association rules** between combinations of products. These rules can help give a notion of regularities in the purchasing behaviors of users. For example, if someone were to buy Product A, what is the chance that the same person would also buy Product B at the same time? The tendency of this is measured by **Confidence**. The competition required the identification of 14328 different relationships in the dataset `rules.csv` with 2 up until 3 different products with differing relationships using a dataset `association_order.csv`consisting of purchase receipts with related products in question.

## The Results
I myself joined the competition with 3 other people with links to their LinkedIn profiles written at the end of this Readme. 5 hours was given but we weren't able to construct an efficient enough code to process the program before the competition ended, so we didn't win at that time. In spite of the loss, weeks later I decided to pursue it myself and created a python notebook consisting of the required syntax to finally acquire an accuracy of 100% through the submission of Kaggle in approximately 35 minutes. The notebook consists of functions, multi-index dataframes, and lambda functions in loops in order to iterate through the whole dataset.
